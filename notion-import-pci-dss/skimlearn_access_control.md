# 🧠 SkimLearn Summary: Access Control Policy (PCI DSS v4.0)

> **Mission:** Understand, apply, and validate access control aligned with PCI DSS v4.0 Requirements 7 & 8.

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- **Access Must Be Justified**  
  Only users with a documented business need should receive access to ADE components.

- **Roles Drive Access**  
  Define roles before provisioning. Roles should tie to responsibilities, not people.

- **Least Privilege is Law**  
  Minimize what each user can access by default.

- **Individual Accountability**  
  Every user must be uniquely identified — no shared logins.
