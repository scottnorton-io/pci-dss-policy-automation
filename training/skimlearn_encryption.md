# 🔐 SkimLearn Summary – Encryption (Req. 3.x)

## PCI DSS Focus Areas:
- 3.4: Render PAN unreadable
- 3.5: Protect cryptographic keys
- 3.6: Define and enforce key management processes

---

## 🔑 Core Principles

- Encrypt PAN using strong algorithms
- Do not store SAD post-auth
- Keys must be stored separately, rotated, and destroyed securely
- Access must be strictly controlled and logged

---

## 📁 Fast Checks

✅ Encryption documented in policy  
✅ Key storage and handling logged  
✅ Access roles and procedures documented  
✅ Diagrams available to support control design
